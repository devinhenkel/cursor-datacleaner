# Data Cleaning App PRD

## Overview
A web-based data cleaning application built with Gradio that allows users to upload CSV/XLSX files, explore data through various EDA functions, and perform data cleaning operations with customizable parameters.

## Product Goals
- Enable users to quickly upload and preview datasets
- Provide comprehensive data exploration capabilities
- Offer flexible data cleaning operations with user-configurable parameters
- Allow continuous data manipulation and export functionality

## User Stories

### 1. Data Upload and Preview
- As a user, I want to upload CSV or XLSX files so that I can work with my data
- As a user, I want to preview the first few rows of my dataset so that I can verify the upload was successful
- As a user, I want to see basic metadata about my dataset (shape, columns, data types)

### 2. Data Exploration
- As a user, I want to view summary statistics for numerical columns
- As a user, I want to view value counts for categorical columns
- As a user, I want to visualize missing values in the dataset
- As a user, I want to see correlation matrices between numerical variables
- As user, I want to generate histograms for numerical columns

### 3. Data Cleaning Operations
- As a user, I want to handle missing values with multiple strategies (delete, mean, median, mode, KNN)
- As a user, I want to remove duplicate rows
- As a user, I want to remove outliers using IQR or Z-score methods
- As a user, I want to convert data types for columns
- As a user, I want to rename columns
- As a user, I want to filter rows based on conditions

### 4. Export and Continue
- As a user, I want to download the cleaned dataset as CSV or XLSX
- As a user, I want to continue performing EDA operations on the cleaned data
- As a user, I want to apply additional cleaning operations after previous operations

### Data Processing Flow
1. File upload → Load data → Display preview
2. EDA operations → Update visualization components
3. Cleaning operations → Apply transformations → Update dataset
4. Export → Save processed data
